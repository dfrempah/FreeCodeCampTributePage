            <p>Kwame Nkrumah was born in about 1909 in Nkroful,
                Gold Coast to a poor and illiterate family.[3] Nkroful was a small village 
                in the Nzema area,[4] in the far southwest of the Gold Coast, close to the frontier
                 with the French colony of the Ivory Coast. His father did not live with the family,
                  but worked in Half Assini where he pursued his goldsmith business until his death.
                   Kwame Nkrumah was raised by his mother and his extended family, who lived together
                    in traditional fashion, with more distant relatives often visiting. He lived a 
                    carefree childhood, spent in the village, in the bush, and on the nearby sea.</p>
            <p>Nkrumah was an activist student, organizing a group of expatriate African students in Pennsylvania and building it into the African Students Association of America and Canada, becoming its president. Some members felt that the group should aspire for each colony to gain independence on its own; Nkrumah urged a Pan-African strategy.[23] Nkrumah played a major role in the Pan-African conference held in New York in 1944, which urged the United States, at the end of the Second World War, to help ensure Africa became developed and free.[24]</p>
            <p>Ghana through Kwame Nkrumah became independent on 6 March 1957. As the first of Britain's African colonies to gain majority-rule independence, the celebrations in Accra were the focus of world attention; over 100 reporters and photographers covered the events. United States President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent congratulations and his vice president, Richard Nixon, to represent the U.S. at the events. The Soviet delegation urged Nkrumah to visit Moscow as soon as possible. Ralph Bunche, an African American, was there for the United Nations, while the Duchess of Kent represented Queen Elizabeth. Offers of assistance poured in from across the world. Even without them, the country seemed prosperous, with cocoa prices high and the potential of new resource development.[69]</p>
            <p>Nkrumah was hailed as the Osagyefo â€“ which means "redeemer" in the Akan language.[72] This independence ceremony included the Duchess of Kent and Governor General Charles Arden-Clarke. With more than 600 reporters in attendance, Ghanaian independence became one of the most internationally reported news events in modern African history.</p>
